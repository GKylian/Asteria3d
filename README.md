# Asteria3d

To launch the code, launch the 'setup' bash script in a UNIX environment (mac OSX or any linux distribution such as Ubuntu). It will guide you through the configuration of Asteria. It will then compile the code into a UNIX executable 'Asteria'. This executable can be either launched directly, or through the 'launch' bash script.

As of 16.09, a few files are missing. This should hopefully be fixed in the followig days.
